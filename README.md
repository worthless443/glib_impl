Sorta my try to implement some chuck of glibc, for learning the dynamics of C and its standard better. For now, it is not very robust and can not guarantee if it will work in other distros, let alone systems with systems identical to mine. 

System of testing this is: `Gentoo - gcc-11.2.1, ldd-2.35`
